Last but not least, like most developers I love getting some (positive) feedback every now and then, so if you like this software PLEASE tell me!!! My email address is as follows (change applicable parts of the address):

                   qwilk_AT_xoblite_DOT_net
Please note that due to a severe lack of time, my response time may be in the range "poor" to "infinity", however I'll try my best to reply to your email(s). Just don't expect too much... :|

Alternatively, you can also tag me on Twitter (@xoblite #xoblite) and perhaps star me here on GitHub. Thanks! =]

Enjoy! :D
